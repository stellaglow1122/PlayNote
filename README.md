# PlayNote
This is a simple project to use powershell to play sounds and people can use it to make the songs they like.

You don't have to download Windows powershell, it is already in your Windows 10 system.
You can download the file and run the script using Windows powershell, or you can copy the code and paste it to Windows powershell.
